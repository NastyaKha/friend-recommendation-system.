      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to present my work on developing a friend recommendation system for the VK social network (a popular platform in Russia) and to contribute to the discussion on improving user experience in digital platforms.</p>
      <p>The project code is available on GitHub: 
        <a href="https://github.com/NastyaKha/friend-recommendation-system" target="_blank">

    <section id="relevance" class="card">
      <h2>Relevance of Developing a Friend Recommendation System</h2>
      <p>VK is one of the most popular social networks with millions of users. It is a large communication platform, but its main problem is selecting the right circle of contacts.</p>
      <p>Although VK already has a recommendation system, it is not perfect. Its primary settings include search by mutual acquaintances and basic attribute filters, which do not always help locate a specific person.</p>
      <h3>Common cases that current systems miss</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Your acquaintance did not attend the same school and you do not remember its name.</li>
        <li>You don’t know their exact place of residence.</li>
        <li>You forgot their last name or they have changed it.</li>
        <li>You don’t know their workplace or they are unemployed.</li>
        <li>You have no mutual acquaintances.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>In such cases, finding the right person becomes nearly impossible — even if you spent hours talking about your favorite music together.</em></p>

    <section id="goals" class="card">
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify the shortcomings of the current friend recommendation system in VK.</li>
        <li>Propose a more optimized algorithm for finding acquaintances and new connections.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="objectives" class="card">
      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Review the principles of the existing system.</li>
        <li>Identify situations not considered by the current system.</li>
        <li>Develop a filtering algorithm and define the most suitable type of recommendation system.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="analysis" class="card">
      <h2>Domain Analysis</h2>
      <p>A <strong>friend recommendation system</strong> automatically suggests potential friends to users. Many social networks such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, VK and others use these systems to improve user engagement.</p>
      <p>Recommendation systems suggest resources of interest based on user behavior and preferences; different approaches and technologies are applied depending on requirements.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="types" class="card">
      <h2>Types of Recommendation Systems</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Content-based filtering</strong> – predicting connections from user activity history (groups, likes, visited profiles).</li>
        <li><strong>Collaborative filtering</strong> – user-based (UBCF) and item-based (IBCF) approaches relying on similarity metrics.</li>
        <li><strong>Knowledge-based filtering</strong> – explicit criteria (gender, genres, communities, games).</li>
        <li><strong>Hybrid filtering</strong> – combining multiple approaches to compensate for weaknesses.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="methods" class="card">
      <h2>Applied Methods</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Method 1: Based on lifestyle and shared interests.</li>
        <li>Method 2: Based on real-time location and user interests.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="criteria" class="card">
      <h2>Criteria</h2>
      <p>The system aims to offer both acquaintance-finding and new-connection discovery.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Include many filtering options (interests, music, games, communities).</li>
        <li>Verify user activity levels to prioritize real accounts.</li>
        <li>Ensure simplicity of use.</li>
        <li>Enable extended search options for premium users.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="features" class="card">
      <h2>Proposed Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Search by groups, games, videos, and music interests.</li>
        <li>Prioritize active users in rankings.</li>
        <li>Suggest connections based on shared lifestyle or hobbies.</li>
        <li>Introduce gamification (friend challenges and rewards).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="conclusion" class="card">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>This project demonstrates the importance of improving friend recommendation systems in modern social networks. By analyzing existing approaches and proposing new filtering criteria, it aims to enhance user experience and make finding friends and like-minded people more effective.</p>
